Summary
-------

This map shows the first 20 restaurants returned from the Yelp API based on the bounds of the map.  The initial map shows Hoover, AL.  However, you have the ability to input any location you wish and the map will update based on what you enter.  The restaurants returned will also update based on the bounds of the new map location.

How to Run
----------
There is no need to go to a URL.  The site will run locally by simply clicking on the index.html file.  The only thing that you need is an internet connection to connect to Google Maps and Yelp.

How to Use
----------

In the list view, you will see the restaurant name, the Yelp user rating, and the phone number.

To narrow down your search, you have a couple options.
1.  Click on the restaurant in the list
2.  Click on the marker on the map.

When either of those 2 things occur, the list view will narrow down the restaurant you selected, the marker on the map will turn blue, and an info window will pop up that shows the name of the restaurant and an image from Yelp.

If you wants to unfilter the list, click on the Refresh List link at the bottom of the list.  If you click on that link, all the restaurants will again be displayed in the list.

Finally
-------
Enjoy the restaurant lookup and I hope you find some good eats.
